1. Prediction of Menstrual Irregularities
Target Variable: Cycle(R/I) (Regular/Irregular)
Potential Predictors: BMI, Cycle_length(days), Age_(yrs), PCOS_(Y/N), FSH(mIU/mL), LH(mIU/mL), AMH(ng/mL), TSH_(mIU/L)
Purpose: To predict whether a woman is likely to have irregular menstrual cycles based on hormonal and physical factors.
2. Prediction of Ovulatory Disorders
Target Variable: FSH/LH ratio or individual hormone levels (FSH(mIU/mL) and LH(mIU/mL))
Potential Predictors: Age_(yrs), BMI, AMH(ng/mL), PCOS_(Y/N), Cycle_length(days)
Purpose: To predict ovulatory dysfunction, which is a key symptom of PCOS, affecting fertility.
3. Impact of Lifestyle Factors on Menstrual Health
Target Variable: Cycle(R/I) or Pregnant(Y/N)
Potential Predictors: Fast_food_(Y/N), Reg.Exercise(Y/N), Weight_gain(Y/N), BMI, PCOS_(Y/N)
Purpose: To analyze how lifestyle factors like diet and exercise impact menstrual regularity and fertility outcomes.
4. Predicting Risk of Miscarriage
Target Variable: No._of_abortions
Potential Predictors: Age_(yrs), BMI, Cycle_length(days), PCOS_(Y/N), AMH(ng/mL), PRG(ng/mL), I___beta-HCG(mIU/mL)
Purpose: To predict the risk of miscarriage based on age, hormone levels, and the presence of PCOS.
5. Prediction of Hyperandrogenism
Target Variable: hair_growth(Y/N), Skin_darkening_(Y/N), Hair_loss(Y/N), Pimples(Y/N)
Potential Predictors: BMI, PCOS_(Y/N), FSH/LH, AMH(ng/mL), TSH_(mIU/L)
Purpose: To predict hyperandrogenism (elevated male hormones) in women with PCOS, which leads to symptoms like excess hair growth and acne.
6. Prediction of Fertility Treatment Outcomes
Target Variable: Success of pregnancy (Pregnant(Y/N))
Potential Predictors: FSH(mIU/mL), LH(mIU/mL), Age_(yrs), Cycle_length(days), Follicle_No._(L), Follicle_No._(R), Avg._F_size_(L)_(mm), Avg._F_size_(R)_(mm)
Purpose: To predict the success of fertility treatments or natural conception for women with PCOS.
7. Effect of Hormonal Imbalance on Endometrial Health
Target Variable: Endometrium_(mm) thickness
Potential Predictors: PCOS_(Y/N), FSH(mIU/mL), LH(mIU/mL), AMH(ng/mL), Cycle_length(days)
Purpose: To predict abnormalities in endometrial thickness, which is crucial for implantation during pregnancy.
8. Prediction of Insulin Resistance
Target Variable: Could create a proxy using variables like BMI, Waist:Hip_Ratio, and PCOS_(Y/N) to identify insulin resistance risk.
Potential Predictors: BMI, Waist:Hip_Ratio, RBS(mg/dl), PCOS_(Y/N)
Purpose: Women with PCOS often have insulin resistance; this prediction can be used to identify risk early on.
These ideas could help you further analyze and predict various health outcomes related to menstrual health and PCOS. If you'd like to implement any of these, I can help with the modeling process!
